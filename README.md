# Sprouts
Sprouts is a mathematical game that was created by John Horton Conway and Michael S. Paterson in 1967. It is a turn-based game played by two players, where the goal is to
strategically draw and connect dots to create new lines. The game starts with a certain number of dots, ùëõ, and players take turns drawing lines between the dots, following specific rules.

This project consists of simulating the game in Python, creating an algorithm to determine the existence of paths, creating an algorithm to draw valid paths between points, implementing graph analysis, and allowing the user to play against a computer. See the "Presentation" folder with the PowerPoint presentation for more details and a demonstration. Also, see the "Video Demonstration" folder for a video demonstration of the app.
